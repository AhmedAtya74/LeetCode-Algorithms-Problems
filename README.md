### What is LeetCode? And how does it work?

Leetcode is a website that helps software engineers (and really anyone for that matter interested in getting a Software engineering job) practice for both online and in person technical interviews. 

Leetcode splits its questions by category (Arrays, Trees, LinkedLists etc.) and also by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). Users of Leetcode can choose to write their code in a language of their choice and once ready, push their solution to the autograder which runs a stream of tests against their solution. The first failing test will display the first line of the expected output which does not match the output from the userâ€™s solution. This can then be used to determine the bug. Multiple iterations of the solution can be pushed to the auto grader prior to successfully completing the problem
